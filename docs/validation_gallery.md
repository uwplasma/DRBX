# Validation Gallery

This page collects the first curated parity figures from the active validation ladder. Each figure is generated from the same committed baseline artifacts used by the regression harness, so the visuals and the automated checks stay in sync.

## Diffusion Short Window

What this locks down:

- structured mesh reconstruction;
- metric normalization on the transport path;
- Neumann guard handling;
- repeated output scheduling over a short transient.

## Electrostatic Vorticity Short Window

![Vorticity short-window parity](images/vorticity_short_window_parity.png)

What this locks down:

- discrete X-Z XPPM advection;
- Boussinesq potential inversion;
- repeated electrostatic output parity for both `Vort` and `phi`.

## Coupled Drift-Wave One Step

![Drift-wave one-step parity](images/drift_wave_one_step_parity.png)

What this locks down:

- coupled density, electron momentum, vorticity, and potential output;
- quasineutral electron closure;
- fixed-temperature electron pressure;
- trimmed active-cell comparisons for the first 2D density-vorticity benchmark.

## Drift-Wave Short-Window Parity

![Drift-wave short-window parity](images/drift_wave_short_window_parity.png)

What this locks down:

- the full 50-output reduced drift-wave transient on the committed benchmark grid;
- benchmark-level growth and frequency agreement on the same stored history used by the regression harness;
- field-error history for `Ni`, `Ne`, `NVe`, `Vort`, and `phi`, published from the same native/reference comparison artifact used in docs and review material;
- the current documented native/reference envelope: max `|Ni-Ne|` error about `1.47e-3`, max `|NVe|` error about `1.70e-4`, max `|Vort|` error about `2.14e-2`, and max `|phi|` error about `4.31e-4`.

## Drift-Wave Short-Window Benchmark

![Drift-wave short-window diagnostics](images/drift_wave_short_window_diagnostics.png)

What this locks down:

- benchmark postprocessing on the committed short-window array baseline;
- measured growth-rate and frequency extraction from the periodic density history;
- analytic finite-electron-mass dispersion evaluation from the same normalization and geometry scalars used by the run;
- documentation-ready reviewer figures backed by automated regression tests.

## Blob2d Short-Window Parity

![Blob2d short-window parity](images/blob2d_short_window_parity.png)

What this locks down:

- the full 50-output sheath-connected blob transient on the recalc-metric benchmark geometry;
- the optimized X-Z ExB transport kernel that made the native long-enough blob run practical without changing the discrete flux formulas;
- benchmark-level parity on reviewer-facing blob diagnostics rather than only pointwise field maxima: peak density excess plus radial and binormal center-of-mass trajectories;
- the current documented native/reference envelope: peak-excess max error about `1.41e-2`, radial COM max error about `6.29e-1` active cells, and binormal COM max error about `7.32e-1` active cells.

## Neutral Mixed Short-Window Benchmark Target

![Neutral mixed short-window diagnostics](images/neutral_mixed_short_window_diagnostics.png)

What this locks down:

- a compact reference-side transient target for the staged neutral branch before the native stiff solver is promoted through the public runner;
- center-probe histories for `Nh`, `Ph`, and `NVh` at the committed benchmark location `(x=5, y=3, z=5)`;
- the derived center temperature `Ph / Nh`, which stays close to the expected `0.1` throughout the short window;
- reviewer-facing compact metrics rather than large raw arrays: final total `Nh` about `7.86197875e+02`, final total `Ph` about `7.86184063e+01`, and final momentum RMS about `5.56121767e-08`.

## Regeneration

These figures are generated from the committed baseline arrays plus native case runs. The current gallery uses:

- `diffusion_short_window`
- `vorticity_short_window`
- `drift_wave_one_step`
- `drift_wave_short_window`
- `blob2d_short_window`

The next gallery pass should add:

- periodic 1D fluid short-window figures;
- native neutral transient parity figures once the stiff `neutral_mixed` path is benchmark-clean;
- benchmark and validation plots for additional open-field-line cases as those stages land.
