# Neutral interactions (minimal model)

Nonlinear SOL simulations often require neutral physics (ionization, recombination, charge-exchange, recycling). As a first step, `jaxdrb` includes a **minimal neutral density** model that can be toggled on/off.

## Additional field

When enabled, the state becomes:

$$
y = (n, \omega, N),
$$

where $N(x,y,t)$ is a neutral particle density.

## Neutral equation

The neutral model is:

$$
\partial_t N + [\phi, N] = D_N \nabla_\perp^2 N + S_0 - \nu_s N - S_{\text{ion}} + S_{\text{rec}}.
$$

Ionization and recombination are modeled as:

$$
S_{\text{ion}} = \nu_{\text{ion}}\,n_{\text{abs}}\,N_{\text{abs}},\qquad
S_{\text{rec}} = \nu_{\text{rec}}\,n_{\text{abs}},
$$

where, in the HW2D milestone, $n$ is treated as a fluctuation about a constant background
$n_{\text{abs}} = n_0 + n$ (with small floors applied to keep the rates physical).

## Coupling to the plasma density

Particle exchange between neutrals and plasma enters the density equation as:

$$
\partial_t n \;\;\leftarrow\;\; \partial_t n + S_{\text{ion}} - S_{\text{rec}}.
$$

With $S_0=0$, $D_N=0$, and $\nu_s=0$, this choice conserves the domain-mean total particle content:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle n + N \rangle = 0.
$$

## Optional charge-exchange-like momentum drag

An additional neutral toggle applies a vorticity drag proxy:

$$
\partial_t \omega \;\leftarrow\; \partial_t \omega - \nu_{\mathrm{cx},\omega}\,N\,\omega.
$$

This is a lightweight momentum-loss closure inspired by charge-exchange damping workflows in
SOL turbulence modeling. It is intentionally simple and meant for controlled ablation studies.

## What this is (and is not)

- This minimal model is meant to be **physically motivated** and **testable**, not complete.
- It provides clean hooks for upcoming additions:
  - more realistic charge-exchange momentum sinks,
  - energy loss terms due to ionization/radiation,
  - recycling sources tied to sheath fluxes and geometry,
  - kinetic neutral closures (or coupling to external neutral solvers).

## Validation gates

Neutral tests include:

- ionization-only total-particle conservation,
- ionization+recombination total-particle conservation,
- analytic source/sink relaxation to $N^\*=S_0/\nu_s$,
- exact charge-exchange vorticity-drag term enforcement.
